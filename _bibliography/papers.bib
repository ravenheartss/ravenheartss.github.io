  abstract={FrAG is a Framework for the Analysis of Games, allowing us to harness game-playing AI techniques to assist in the reverse engineering of historical video games for which the binary form of the game is the only thing remaining. Moreover, FrAG allows us to perform this task at scale, and search for patterns of game development that might otherwise be overlooked. Game development is done by humans, of course; our interdisciplinary approach is not exclusively technical, and also involves the field of archaeology and its well-established theories of humans and technology. Here we present FrAGâ€™s architecture along with our preliminary results using the framework on a test suite of Atari 2600 games.},

abstract = {The Atari 2600 was a prominent early video game console that had broad cultural impact, and possessed an extensive catalog of games that undoubtedly helped shape the fledgling game industry. How were these games created? We examine one development practice, code re-use, across a large-scale corpus of 1,984 ROM images using an analysis system we have developed. Our system allows us to study code re-use at whole-corpus granularity in addition to finer-grained views of individual developers and companies. We combine this corpus analysis with a case study: one of the co-authors was a third-party developer for Atari 2600 games in the early 1980s, providing insight into why code re-use could occur through both oral history and artifacts preserved for over forty years. Finally, we frame our results about this development practice with an interdisciplinary, bigger-picture archaeological view of humans and technology.},
