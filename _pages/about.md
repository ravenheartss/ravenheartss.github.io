Hello! I am a computer scientist who recently completed my Master's degree.

Iâ€™m currently interested in systems, programming languages, program analysis, and compilers. I also enjoy working on various projects, such as a book manager and downloader, and I love learning new languages. For more details about my work, please see my publications and CV.
